I am submitting this project for Android app. 

It took me about 4-5 days to be ready to submit my 2nd project, since this was my first "real" project working with Unity. 

One thing I liked about the project is that it forces the student to play around with the unity tools because of the tasks given. 

One of the challenging things in this project was getting the globe's trigger to work properly.
